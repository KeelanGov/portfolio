                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a highly motivated Machine Learning Engineer with significant experience designing, implementing, and managing robust, scalable, and cost-effective cloud-native systems. My foundation includes a <strong>BSc Honours degree in Computer Science, from which I graduated Magna Cum Laude</strong> from the University of the Western Cape.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My professional journey includes impactful roles at leading companies such as <strong>Kingmakers</strong> (Senior Machine Learning Engineer), <strong>Capitec Bank</strong> (Intermediate Machine Learning Engineer), and <strong>The Shoprite Group of Companies</strong> (Machine Learning Engineer & Data Science Apprentice). Through these roles, I've gained deep expertise in cloud architecture (Azure & AWS), MLOps, DevOps practices, and infrastructure automation (Terraform). I excel at translating complex requirements into efficient, well-designed technical solutions.
                </p>
                 <p>
                    My background includes leading cloud infrastructure initiatives, architecting end-to-end ML systems (like contextual bandits and recommender engines), and establishing operational best practices. I bring this practical experience and strategic thinking to every technical challenge.
